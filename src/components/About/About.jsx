                My path to becoming a software engineer wasn't a linear path.
                Coming out of high school I innocently chose to pursue a degree
                in computer systems engineering, primarily drawn by my interests
                in computers growing up.

                It wasn't until I was approaching my 2nd year of studies until I
                was aware of all the potential software development offered. I
                made an official switch to the Software Engineering program and
                never looked back! I couldn't be more thrilled to be a part of
                this community.
