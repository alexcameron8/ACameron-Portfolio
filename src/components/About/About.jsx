            {"My path to becoming a software engineer wasn't a straight path. I initially chose to pursue a degree in computer systems engineering, drawn by my interests in computers growing up. It wasn't until I was approaching my 2nd year of studies until I was aware of all the potential software development offered. I made the official switch to the Software Engineering program and never looked back! I have always been an advocate for immersing myself around technology and couldn't be more thrilled to be a part of this community."}
